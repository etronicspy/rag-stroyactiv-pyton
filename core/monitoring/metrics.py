"""High-level re-exports for metrics utilities.

This module previously contained dynamic fallbacks to the legacy implementation in
``backup.core.monitoring.metrics``.  The project has fully migrated to the new
implementation under ``core.logging.metrics``.  All legacy fallbacks have been
removed to simplify the dependency graph and eliminate obsolete code paths.

See also: ``PLAN_DOCS/LEGACY_CODE_REMOVAL_PLAN.md``.
